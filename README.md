# MinesweeperOS

### Why??

My incredible code shall only grace the CPU if it's run completely dependency-free and entirely natively. For this I have created an INCREDIBLE and REVOLUTIONARY operating system that runs a very bad version of Minesweeper.

##### (The real reason I made this)
I created this to learn how computers REALLY work at a low-level. In this, I use a mixture of C and x86 assembly to create a full on OS (more of a kernel, really, but I don't care) that only runs Minesweeper. 

### The (excellent) tutorials I used to actually learn this stuff
